# Factorial Web App Read Me

## **_Overview_**

Welcome to the Factorial Web App!

This app allows users to input any positive integer to be factorialed within the first form input, then if the user wishes, can see if any given number can be unfactorialed (or to find the factorial root) using the second form input. This program dynamically updates the form inputs when the user inputs any positive integer within any of the form inputs. This program utilizes a Javascript backend to do all calculations. Along with a THREE.js 3D animation space for the background. TinkedCAD was used to create the 3D CAD files and supporting THREE.js files were used to utilize those 3D CAD files within the 3D space.

## **_How To Run_**

If you wish to run this program, I would suggest starting your own localhost and open this files from any browser. For testing purposes, I use the Live Server extension used in VSCode. Feel free and welcome to use any method to run this program. 

## **_Additonal Notes_**

_Supprting Libraries_

This project contains libraries I have create along with supporting libraries. The Javascript files; mtl.js, obj.js, and three.js, are supporting libraries from the THREE.js community to assist in creating a 3D enviroment with obj files. 

_Naive Form Validation_

This project does not contain any form validation. It is assumed that the user will only input positive integers that can be factorialed. No testing has been done with any other input other than positive integers.
