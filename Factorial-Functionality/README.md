# Read Me Before Running! (or Walking)

This set of java executable programs are purely proof of concept for a factorial calculator within the java language.

## _Fair Warning:_ 

These programs can and will break in many ways, this is just proof of concept to find a good way to 
start and create a factorial calculator. Along with this, Java primitive type of _int_ can only hold and store up to a 
certain number, this is also the case for the primitive type _long_. _long_ does have a higher cap, therefore we 
continued to utilize this higher cap to print out and store those higher numbers. 

## To Run Tests
_src/TestDriver_

Access the TestDriver executable to see a couple pre-made tests ranging from 1-20 as the input for both the 
recursive and linear calls. Run the java file to see that all tests work and see which random number were used in 
VersusTest.

## To Run the User-Facing Program
_src/UserDriver_

Access the UserDriver executable to see a User-Facing program that allows the user to input any number into the program 
print out the Linear and Recursive solution of the factorial number. Again, we use the same methods from Factorial.java, 
therefore there is still a cap of what factorial number you can input.
